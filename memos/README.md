This folder contains a bunch of memos, that explain design decisions made at certain parts of the
development process. It is part devlog, part documentation, and a place where I can write down ideas
about the game as it crystallizes more and more. Some of the memos, especially the older ones,
might not be up-to-date (though I will try to make an update memo whenever I make a big change),
but they aren't meant to be a perfect documentation of the code - code comments will be a much more
updated way to do that.

Here is a list of memos, in order of creation
