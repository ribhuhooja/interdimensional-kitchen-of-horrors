Here is a picture of how I want (player) movement to look like in the final game - 
the player uses the WASD keys as buttons and moves around; there is no diagonal movement.
Objects can be pushed by the player (and without an inventory, that is the only way the player
can move things around). Later I might also add the ability for the player to "face" a direction 
without moving in it if sufficiently complicated interactions are added.

From a technical perspective, movement is bounded on the tiles. So it is not the Player which updates
its own transform but rather the grid which tells it the position to move to (animations might still be controlled
by the player). This is the same for all the placeable objects, and all movement (especially push movement) must go through
the grid which decides when a move can or cannot occur (for instance pushing into a wall, etc.)

This is distinct from how I envision monsters to move, because they will first have an into-the-breach esque telegraphing
period, an then move all at once. I will probably handle that as more of a smooth movement, though it will STILL have to go 
through the ground. In the end the ground manages all the movement interactions between different parts of the system.
